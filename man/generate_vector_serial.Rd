\title{Generate a Discretized Serial Interval Distribution}
\usage{
generate_vector_serial(nt, mean_si, sd_si)
}
\arguments{
\item{nt}{An integer specifying the number of time points (length of the distribution).}

\item{mean_si}{A numeric value representing the mean of the serial interval distribution.}

\item{sd_si}{A numeric value representing the standard deviation of the serial interval distribution.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{nt} representing the discretized serial interval distribution.
}
\description{
This function generates a discretized serial interval distribution based on
the gamma distribution characterized by the specified mean and standard deviation.
}
\details{
The serial interval distribution is discretized using a gamma distribution
with shape and scale parameters derived from the specified mean and standard deviation.
The discretization is performed by computing the difference in the cumulative distribution
function (CDF) of the gamma distribution at successive integer time points.
